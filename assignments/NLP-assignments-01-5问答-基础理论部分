基础理论部分
0. Can you come up out 3 sceneraies which use AI methods?

Ans:{Text translator、Search engine、AlphaGo}
1. How do we use Github; Why do we use Jupyter and Pycharm;

Ans: {Now I have learned how to use Github, We will use it to upload assignments and download the source code and information provided by the teacher.
Because it's easy to demonstrate, and it's a convenient development environment, you can upload code to Github.}
2. What's the Probability Model?

Ans:{A mathematical model describing the relationship between different random variables.}
3. Can you came up with some sceneraies at which we could use Probability Model?

Ans:{Weather forecast; Sweepstakes; Risk assessment.}
4. Why do we use probability and what's the difficult points for programming based on parsing and pattern match?

Ans:{Calculating the probability of a sentence appearing by counting is a way of parsing language. It is relatively simple and easy to implement.
Difficult points: 1.The flexibility and variability of natural language; 2. The size of the corpus is always limited.}
5. What's the Language Model;

Ans:{The probability-based language model analyzes the statement, determines the correctness of the input statement, and outputs the probability of the statement.}
6. Can you came up with some sceneraies at which we could use Language Model?

Ans:{Mobile phone input method; Speech Recognition}
7. What's the 1-gram language model;

Ans:{Gram means grammar unit, 1-gram means only calculate the probability of a single word.}
8. What's the disadvantages and advantages of 1-gram language model;

Ans:{Disadvantages: 1. Did not consider the order in which words appear;2. Unable to reflect the dependencies between words and words.
Advantage: The calculation is simple.}
9. What's the 2-gram models;

Ans:{If the appearance of a word depends only on a word that appears before it, then we call it Bi-gram.}
